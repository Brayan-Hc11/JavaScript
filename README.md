JavaScript is a programming or scripting language that allows you to implement complex functions in web pages, any time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to view, it displays timely content updates, interactive maps, 2D/3D Graphics animation, scrolling video player machines, etc., you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It's the third layer of the standard web technologies pie, two of which (HTML and CSS) we've covered in much more detail elsewhere in the Learning Area.
